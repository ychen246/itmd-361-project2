            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My name is Yujun Chen and I'm a fourth year computer science major. I expect to be finish with my bachaleor by the end of the year. I was born on June 15 1996 near the southern port city of Guangzhou, China. I lived there for six year before immigrating to America, around June 2002, stopping by Hongkong on my birthday during the journey. I have lived in Chicago since then, going through the moiton of school from kindergarten to now my fourth year of college, and hopefully my last year for a good while.</p>
            <h3>Some Trivia about myself.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I got into fights a lot as a kid, even trying to fight people older than me despite being a small kid.</li>
                <li>I got into trouble a lot too, mostly because I didn't do my homework.</li>
                <li>I was also arguably one of the smartest kid in my grade during elementary despite my nonexistent work ethic.</li>
                <li>Of the few places I have been to, Seattle and Toronto are probably my favorite two.</li>
                <li>My grandpa was the one person I looked up to the most, despite him being present only for the first six years of my life.</li>
                <li>I attended the number one public highschool of chicago. Northside College Prep.</li>
                <li>I was really good at Chemistry and Economic, so there was a 1/3 chance of me majoring in those two instead of Computer Science.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>My Friends</h2>

                <h3>Avdo</h3>
                <p>My longest standing friend from highschool. Meet him in my very first class, PE, where I introduce myself by my English name Brian for some reason. That never really stuck around past the first few days, but this friend of mine certainly did whether I want it or not.</p>

                <h3>Joseph and Jose</h3>
                <p>On the left is Joseph and on the right is Jose. I met Joseph through a mutual friend from highschool, but I really get to know him when I came to IIT and he was in my humanity class. God, he can be infuriating at times, but thanks to him, I met another great friend, Joseph's best friend from highschool, Jose. This guy is pretty cool, even when he gets mad at a video game, Joseph on the other hand is very uncool.</p>

                <h3>Jenny and Kim</h3>
                <p>On the right is my friend Jenny and on the left is Kim. I met Jenny in freshmen year of highschool, and were only pretty friendly terms. She was really helpful and smart, and through some sheer coincidence, kept ending up in the same classes as me. Eventually, we became good friend and lunch buddies, especially during senior year. The one on the left is Kim and even though I meet her later on and don't exactly remember how we came to become friend during highschool, she's the one homie I still see and talk to often.</p>
